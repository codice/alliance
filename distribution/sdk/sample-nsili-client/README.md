# [Codice Alliance](http://github.com/codice/alliance/)

## Mock NSILI Client

Codice Alliance contains a sample NSILI client to be used for testing purposes.  This utility can be run from the command-line within the sample-nsili-client directory by using maven and specifying a web port.

```
mvn -Pcorba.client -Dexec.args=IORURL
e.g. mvn -Pcorba.client -Dexec.args="url=http://localhost:20002/data/ior.txt"
     mvn -Pcorba.client -Dexec.args="url=https://localhost:8993/services/nsili/ior.txt,email=test@test.com"
```
