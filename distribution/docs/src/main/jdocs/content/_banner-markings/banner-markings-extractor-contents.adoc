:summary: Banner Markings extractor.

${branding} will extract banner markings and translate markings into a format that ${branding}
can handle.

[WARNING]
====
If other transformers or extractors have already assigned security markings to the
security attributes that the Banner Markings Extractor extracted from the banner markings,
and the pre-existim markings do not match those extracted from the banner markigns, then
the ingest will be rejected due to prevent a data spill, since the correct markings
cannot be determined.
