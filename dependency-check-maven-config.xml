            doesn't exist in 1.14/1.15 so this is a false positive.

            This CVE references a problem with the Utf8DecoderBase::WriteUtf16Slow function in the
            file unicode-decoder.cc. This file is found in certain versions of Google V8 and used in
            Node.js. Using these files may allow attackers to use a crafted byte sequence and "have
            impact via unknown vectors." Since we do not depend on these packages, this is believed
            to be a false positive from OWASP.

            This CVE references a problem with deserializing specifically crafted serialized Java
            objects when using the Apache Commons Collections library. Although we use this library,
            we currently do not allow deserialization of "arbitary, user-supplied Java serialized
            data" which this vulnerability depends on.
